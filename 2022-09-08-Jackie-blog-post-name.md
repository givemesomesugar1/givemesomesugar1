<legend> The first three I wil be learning in my journey to make a sufficient blog:</lengend>
<ul>
  <li>Html</li>
  <li>CSS</li>
  <li>Javascript</li>
</ul>
<h3> Html</h3>
<p> Learning HTML was not too difficult, as I was still (and am) new to the world of coding; but I realize there is still so much to learn beyond the basics. This blog will be my first project that I do. It is showing promise to me. This will entail what kind of codes I would have learned. <a href='https://www.rasmussen.edu/degrees/technology/blog/why-learn-to-code' target=_blank>Click this Univeristy's article to find out the benfits of coding.</a></p>
<br>
<p> Examples of Keycodes that I have learned so far:</p>
<ol>
<li>Naming headers and their sizes for ex: h1, h2, h3-h6</li>
<li>Tables: table, tr for row, td for data </li>
<li>Bullet points and number points for ex: ul for bullet & ol for numbers; also li for the actual data info</li>
<li>Paragraphs and breaks ex: p & br</li>
<li>Hyperlinking and connecting websites ex: a href=#, target=_blank</li>
<li>Attaching images, and videos using img & video</li>
 <li>list and buttons ex: radio button & datalist</li>
 </ol>

  <h3>CSS</h3>
<p> CSS looks really cool in how it is needed to be able to visually see the color, borders, and etc.<p>
